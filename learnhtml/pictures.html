        <p>Paper cranes are a symbol of peace. After World War II, many paper cranes 
        were sent to Japan as a symbol of peace. There is a myth in China that if you fold 1000 paper cranes, 
        then you will be granted a wish. The paper crane is the first thing that I learned to fold. 
        It has a special place in my heart because of that. Although I have stopped folding as much origami, 
        I have never forgotten how to fold one. It means a lot to me and it is a very simple way to start learning origami 
        and becoming part of this ancient art. Instructions can be found <a href="instructions.html">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Elephants are simply majestic creatures. They are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.</p>

        <p>Dragons in Asian folklore and culture are very important. Dragons were considered a type of majestic beast that dwells in rivers, lakes, and oceans and roams the skies. Originally a rain divinity, the Chinese dragon, unlike its malevolent European counterpart, is associated with heavenly beneficence and fecundity. Rain rituals as early as the 6th century BCE involved a dragon image animated by a procession of dancers; similar dances are still practiced in traditional Chinese communities to secure good fortune.</p>

        <p>Modular origami is when you take multiple pieces of paper, fold them up, and then slot them into each other. Some purists would not consider this method "true" origami. Nonetheless, I find it extremely interesting and is one of my favorite things to fold.
