                    "I didn't interact with Jimmy Jim&trade; personally. I needed 
                    some photos of our facilities taken, so I had my assistant Ashley
                    arrange for a photographer to come by. That was a strange day. 
                    Several pipes burst, there was a small microwave fire, and there 
                    were a ton of mice underfoot. The pictures he took were amazing 
                    and we'll be able to use them for years. Ashley seems a bit 
                    more of an ideal employee since he came. She is the perfect, 
                    emotionless employee." - Jeffery Bimbo

                    at those photos that Jimmy Jim&trade; took for my LinkedIn

                    He just took my picture while I was flipping a pancake and left. 
                    I've begun to think that maybe a picture isn't all he took." - Mark Hanson
