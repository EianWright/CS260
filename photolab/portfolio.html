                    This bridge picture was taken on the trails of the rural Oklahoma. 
                    There are claims that it was destroyed by flames from the sky 
                    shortly after this picture was taken, but Jimmy Jim denies that 
                    these rumors are true.

                    This scenic picture was taken moments before all the snow melted 
                    off of the mountains due to an unknown heat source, coming down 
                    the valley in a huge flood causing hundreds of thousands of dollars 
                    in damage.

                    This fallen tree was found on the same rural trail in Oklahoma. 
                    Although some may claim that it was pushed over by Jimmy's super-human 
                    strength granted by the devil, Jimmy once again must deny these 
                    baseless allegations against him.

                    Jimmy enjoys taking wedding pictures. This couple is extremely 
                    happy in this photo, although word of mouth is that they both
                    ended up in the ER in the following weeks with the doctors being 
                    unable to provide a reason for their ailments.

                    This is an example of Jimmy's stealth photos. Here we can see 
                    that Jimmy was able to catch this man in conversation while 
                    holding a dog that he swore he'd never get. Although it is 
                    debated if animals have souls, the dog probably doesn't have 
                    one after this photo.

                    Jimmy has said of this picture, "This picture perfectly encapsulates

                    Jimmy was taking pictures at a rodeo when all of the sudden 
                    disaster struck. Multiple livestock suddenly broke free (including 
                    bucking bulls), a portion of the seating caught on fire, and 
                    the concessions exploded. Miraculously no one was seriously injured, 
                    although Jimmy was banned for life and several attendees said that 
                    they felt like they had lost something.
