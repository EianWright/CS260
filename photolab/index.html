                    Jimmy Jim&trade; is here to change the industry norms. He is 
                    here to shake things up and be a real force for difference in 
                    photography. He has made a personal, deep, irrevocable commitment 
                    to himself (and definitely not with the devil) to always be 
                    there for the photo. If this means breaking into your house 
                    without permission, he  do it. If this means hiking for 
                    5 days into the wilderness during an intense thunderstorm, hurricane, 
                    or blizzard without food, water or shelter, he will do it. Jimmy 
                    Jim is committed to his art and will <strong>always</strong> 
                    be there. He also swears to <em>"never"</em> steal your soul 
                    through photos. It's not like he needs it. He assuredly still 
                    has his (because he most certainly didn't lose it from dealing 
                    with the devil).
