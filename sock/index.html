Finally he questioned the most important thing and for what he is most known for today. Why two socks? After all, socks are wonderful creatures all on their own. There's no need to tear down their self-esteem by selling them in pairs. So Sam decided to be bold and do what no man has done before...sell socks singularly. We are proud to present "Sock!", Sam's original creation.</p>
